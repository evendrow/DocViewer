# DocViewer

DocViewer is a simple project build on top of [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) and [ViewerJS](https://github.com/kogmbh/ViewerJS). PDF.js is a "Portable Document Format (PDF) viewer that is built with HTML5." DocViewer allows you to upload any document, which is then sent to ooffice to be converted to a pdf. You can then view document thumbnails (generated by PDF.js) or view the document using an embeddable web viewer.

2. Change lines 69 and 70 of app.js to point to your install of openoffice and contain the proper directory of your node project  
3. Run to install all dependencies:  
```
npm install  
```
4. Start the server with:  
```
node app.js  
```
