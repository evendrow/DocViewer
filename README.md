# DocViewer

DocViewer is a simple project build on top of [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) and [ViewerJS](https://github.com/kogmbh/ViewerJS) which allows you to upload documents, convert them to PDF, and view them. Supported file formats range from PDFs and DOCs to images. You can also view document thumbnails (generated by PDF.js) or view the document using an embeddable web viewer.  
In order to run DocViewer:  
1. Make sure to have openoffice (or a fork of it) installed  
2. Change lines 68 and 69 of app.js to point to your install of openoffice and contain the proper directory of your node project  
3. Run to install all dependencies:  
```
npm install  
```
4. Start the server with:  
```
node app.js  
```
